Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

--

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified. Ask the questions in a format it is easy to answer, multiple answer questions tags as A,B,C so easy to answer

Example
1 - Question
  A - Possible answer
  B - 2nd possible answer
  C....

Notes:
- Don't over-engineer, keep it simple when possible
- DRY, check if function or type already exists before introduce a new one

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
