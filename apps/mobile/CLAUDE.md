# Fressh Mobile App

## Build Configuration

- **Platform**: Android only
- **Build System**: EAS (local preview builds by default)

### Building

Use a local preview build:

```bash
pnpm exec eas build --local --profile preview --platform android
```

Signing lane rule for `com.finalapp.vibe2`:

- Keep one signing lane per package ID.
- Do not mix differently signed APKs on the same install.
- Before uninstall/reinstall, export backup JSON from
  `Settings -> Backup & Restore` to preserve private keys/connections.

For the full preview build + OTA update procedure (including native/UniFFI
changes), see: `docs/dev-builds.md`.

### Native Dependencies

When Rust code changes (e.g., in `packages/react-native-uniffi-russh`), a new
EAS build is required to regenerate UniFFI bindings.
